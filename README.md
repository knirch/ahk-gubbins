Various gubbins I've needed

## tabber.ahk

A simple Alt-Tab implementation I found on the AHK [forum][link].

At the time I had an idea of a "next-window" implementation and planned to use this as a base to find the active window in the list, and activate the item that came after it.

I never got around to do that, and I don't remember why I needed that application.
